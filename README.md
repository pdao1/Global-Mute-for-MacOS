# Global-Mute-for-MacOS
A simple AppleScript that you can bind to a hotkey to toggle microphone mute/unmute globally, rather than needing to find the application window of your video-conferencing application to mute.  By default, it sets microphone output level to 0% on mute, and sets output level to 75% on unmute.
