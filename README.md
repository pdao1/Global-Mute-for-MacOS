# Global-Mute-for-MacOS
# Description
A simple AppleScript that you can bind to a hotkey to toggle microphone mute/unmute globally, without needing to find the Google Meets tab or Zoom window, useful if you really need to mute at a moments notice but you can't find it in a sea of 50 other tabs and countless windows. 

By default, it sets microphone output level to 0% on mute, and sets output level to 75% on unmute.

# Instructions

Place the "Global Toggle Microphone Mute" workflow in your Services folder:

Finder Navigation Bar > Go > Go to Folder:

Replace 'your-user-name' in this path below with your computer username and then paste it inside the Go to Folder:

/Users/your-user-name/Library/Services

# Setting the hotkey

Go to Settings > Keyboard > Shortcut > Services to find Global Toggle Microphone Mute on the list, then set a hotkey for it. Set it to something unique that other applications aren't using so it doesn't interfere.
